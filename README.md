My own implementation of a neural Network from scratch using Python and Numpy
The aim of this project is to learn how different a neural network and other algoritmhs are working. 

### To run the project:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Atroooo/My_Neural_Network.git
cd My_Neural_Network
```
```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install numpy
pip install nnfs
```

When it's done, all the test file are contained in Neural_network/tests. To try them out just move them into the Neural_network and run them as follow:
```bash
cd Neural_network
python test.py
```

test_real_data.py being the latest test.
